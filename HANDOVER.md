# Handover: Dream Home Designer

Updated 2026-10-30 at the end of the second build session (Phase 0 verified, Phase 1
built). Read this once, then use `CLAUDE.md` for day-to-day conventions.

- **Repo:** https://github.com/zeecm/dream-home-designer (private). Only the owner merges to
  `main`; work happens on a branch with a pull request.
- **Product and technical plan (source of truth for scope and phases):**
  https://claude.ai/artifact/Wu33FsPzhspwQJBwgxeaP5
- **Owner:** zeecm. Backend engineer whose daily language is Go; also writes TypeScript.
- **Live:** production https://dream-home-designer.pages.dev (from `main`); each branch gets a
  preview, e.g. https://claude-magical-noether-1zc17.dream-home-designer.pages.dev.

## 1. What we're building

A free, browser-based home designer: upload a floor plan image, calibrate its scale, trace
walls over it, add doors, windows and furniture, and walk through the result in first
person (WASD + mouse). The project file is plain JSON that the user owns.

The pitch against Planner 5D, HomeByMe, Coohom and Sweet Home 3D is that it's free, quick
(plan to walkthrough in under 10 minutes) and open. v1 is single-user, single-floor and
desktop-first. Automatic floor-plan recognition, multi-floor, photoreal rendering,
real-time collaboration and shopping/cost features are explicitly out of scope for v1.
The full feature inventory is in the plan doc.

## 2. Decisions already made (do not relitigate without the owner)

| Decision | Choice | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Floor plan input | User traces walls over an image underlay; auto-recognition is Phase 4+ | Reliable and quick to ship |
| Frontend | Vite + React 18 + React Three Fiber + drei + Zustand + Immer + zod | R3F keeps the scene reactive to the store |
| React version | 18, not 19 | R3F v8 / drei v9 compatibility. Upgrade together with R3F v9 later |
| Backend language | **Go** (confirmed by owner) | Owner's daily language. The API never touches geometry |
| Backend libraries | **Standard library only** (chi + pgx + sqlc + goose were the plan) | Go 1.22+ `ServeMux` covers routing; the R2 client signs SigV4 itself |
| Web hosting | **Cloudflare Pages, connected to GitHub** (owner asked for this) | `main` deploys production, every other branch a preview, with PR comments |
| API hosting | **Cloudflare Containers** behind a Worker (`apps/edge`), replacing Fly.io | Owner upgraded to Workers Paid to unblock it. Pages reaches it through a Pages Function and a service binding, so the app stays same-origin |
| Project storage (until Postgres) | **R2**, one object per project, conditional writes for optimistic concurrency | Containers have no persistent disk. Postgres on Neon still arrives in Phase 4 behind the same `store.Store` interface |
| Document storage | The project is one JSON document; the server validates only the envelope | Keeps the schema in one place (zod in `packages/core`) |
| Wall model | Walls reference **shared vertex ids**; the wall tool splits walls where they meet or cross | Dragging a corner moves every wall at it, and rooms can be found from the wall graph |
| Rooms | **Detected** from the wall graph's faces inside each topology-changing command | Rooms can't drift from walls; names survive edits by matching faces to old rooms |
| Openings | Rectangular only; walls are solid prisms around them. **No CSG** | Simpler and faster |
| Wall corners | Mitred in `core/footprints.ts`; a hub polygon fills T and X junctions | One outline feeds both the 2D plan and the 3D extrusion |
| 2D editor | SVG, not canvas | Free hit-testing at this element count |
| Undo/redo | Immer patches per command; `coalesceKey` merges drags and multi-wall tools | No hand-written inverses |
| Units | Metres and radians everywhere. Plan (x, y) maps to world (x, 0, y), +Y up | |
| Visual style | taste-skill "framed sheet" app style (seed 69376578), IBM Plex Sans, colour on data only | Owner asked to use taste-skill; it is vendored in `.claude/skills/design-taste-frontend` |

Still open (from the plan doc): MIT open-sourcing at beta; whether "before/after"
variants go in v1; whether to ship HDB BTO layout presets as templates.

### API (current)

| Method | Path | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /healthz | `{"status":"ok"}` |
| GET | /projects | Summaries, newest first. **Off in production** (`LIST_PROJECTS=off`) until auth exists |
| POST | /projects | Full document. Stored as version 1. 409 if the id exists |
| GET | /projects/{id} | Document. `ETag: "<version>"`. 400 for unsafe ids, 404 if missing |
| PUT | /projects/{id} | Requires `If-Match: "<n>"` (428 without it). 409 + `{"version": current}` if stale |
| DELETE | /projects/{id} | 204 |

Writes are rate-limited per IP at the Worker (60/min). IDs must match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$`.

### Client model

- **Backend:** the app probes `/api/healthz` once (20 s timeout for a cold container). With no API
  it uses localStorage with the same versions and 409s, and says so in a notice.
- **Projects:** the open project's id is in the URL (`?p=`). A first visit opens a fresh copy of the
  sample flat (never a shared one). The project menu lists projects this browser has opened,
  because the public API doesn't list.
- **Saving:** sync is loading, saved, dirty, saving, conflict or error. Every edit autosaves 2 s
  later. A conflict offers "Load the latest" or "Keep mine". Leaving with unsaved, conflicting or
  failed changes warns.
- **Plan images:** stored in IndexedDB under `underlay.assetKey`, so they show only in the browser
  that uploaded them.

## 4. State

**Phase 0** is verified. The Phase 0 gate passed in a browser, and CI is green.

**Phase 1 (plan editor)** is built:
- **Image work:** upload an image or PDF, set its opacity and rotation, then set the scale.
- **Walls and rooms:** the wall tool has snapping and typed lengths, the room tool draws
  rectangles, and walls can be edited (drag corners, double-click to split, delete, set length or
  thickness). Rooms are detected automatically.
- **Openings:** a door, window or opening tool places them, and the inspector edits them.
- **Plan and 3D:** walls have mitred corners in both views, and the 3D rebuild is incremental.

**Tests:**
- 78 core and 10 render unit tests, plus 11 web unit tests.
- A 5-test end-to-end suite.
- Go tests, including a store contract test that has passed against live R2.

**Independent acceptance testing, round 1, found:** cropped Split view, the Esc handling in
Measure, door hit areas, the conflict dead end, the bad-link error, phone status and labels, and
the sample's misplaced master door. All of these are fixed.

**Independent UX review, round 1, found:** onboarding, typed lengths breaking geometry, guidance,
hit targets and the 3D pane's behaviour. Fixed or addressed.

**Round 2:** the Phase 1 gate (tracing the real HDB PDF) and a code and architecture review were
running when this was written. Read their findings in the PR or session before Phase 2.

## 5. Owner to-dos

1. **Repository secrets for automatic API deploys.** Add `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (Workers Scripts,
   Containers and Durable Objects edit) and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`. Until then, deploy the API by
   hand with the commands in §8. The web app already deploys through Pages' Git integration.
2. **Domain:** point it at the Pages project. The `/api` routing comes with it.
3. **Merge** the open PR when happy.

## 6. Next

**Finish Phase 1**, in order:
1. Act on round-2 findings, especially friction tracing the real HDB plan. Gate target: a real
   plan traced in under 10 minutes, with internal area within 3% of HDB's stated 66 m².
2. **Merge corners:** a corner dragged onto another corner should merge them (not built yet).
3. **Live lengths during corner drags:** show live lengths on connected walls, and offer the
   connected wall lengths in the Corner inspector.
4. **Keyboard access to plan objects:** focusable canvas, arrow keys to cycle objects, nudging.
5. **Plan images on the server:** upload them to R2 through the API so they work on every device.
6. **A realistic sample:** replace the simple sample flat with a realistic HDB 4-room layout
   (bathrooms, shelter, service yard). Keep `hdb4room` for tests.

**Phase 2, first-person walkthrough:**
- PointerLockControls.
- A capsule colliding with a wall BVH (three-mesh-bvh), with door passages excluded from
  collision.
- A touch joystick on phones.

`LevelMeshes` already gives one mesh per wall, with `userData.wallId`. The plan doc has the
algorithm notes and the checklists for Phases 3 to 5.

## 7. Conventions

- Every document mutation goes through a `Command` in `packages/core/src/commands.ts`.
  UI code never mutates the project directly.
- Generate ids outside the recipe (as `addWall` does) so recipes are deterministic and
  the caller knows the new ids.
- Geometry lives in `packages/core` with unit tests. `packages/render` only converts to
  three.js.
- When the schema changes: bump `SCHEMA_VERSION` in `schema.ts` **and** `SchemaVersion`
  in `apps/api/internal/project/project.go`, add a migration in core, and regenerate
  `apps/api/internal/project/testdata/hdb4room.json` from the fixture.
- TypeScript is strict with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` on. Biome formats with single
  quotes, 2 spaces and 100 columns. Go code is gofmt-clean.
- Commits are small and imperative.

- Front-end work follows the vendored taste-skill: run `inspect.mjs --app` on the
  production build and look at the screenshots. In this container Chrome needs a wrapper that
  adds `--no-sandbox` (set `CHROME_PATH`).

## 8. Commands

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev                                 # web on :5173, proxies /api to :8080
pnpm test | pnpm typecheck | pnpm lint
pnpm --filter @dhd/web e2e               # Playwright: builds, starts the Go API in memory
cd apps/api && go run ./cmd/api          # file store in ./data (STORE=memory to skip disk)
cd apps/api && go test -race ./...
# live R2 contract test (use the dhd-test bucket only; it deletes everything it lists)
R2_TEST_ENDPOINT=https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com R2_TEST_BUCKET=dhd-test \
  R2_TEST_ACCESS_KEY=... R2_TEST_SECRET_KEY=... go test -run TestR2Live ./internal/store
# API Worker + Container (needs Docker and CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN / CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID)
pnpm --filter @dhd/edge deploy           # production: dhd-api
pnpm --filter @dhd/edge deploy:preview   # previews: dhd-api-preview
```

**Cloudflare resources:**
- **Pages:** the `dream-home-designer` project, Git-connected. It binds `API` to `dhd-api` in
  production and to `dhd-api-preview` in previews.
- **Workers with Containers:** `dhd-api` and `dhd-api-preview`.
- **R2 buckets:** `dhd-projects`, `dhd-projects-preview` and `dhd-test`.
- **Bucket-scoped tokens:** `dhd-api-r2-production` and `dhd-api-r2-preview`. Their S3 credentials
  are set as Worker secrets `R2_ACCESS_KEY` and `R2_SECRET_KEY`.

## 9. Known gaps and debts

- **No auth.** A project is reachable by anyone with its link, so ids are the capability. Listing
  is off in production, and writes are rate-limited. Auth arrives in Phase 4.
- **Plan images are browser-local**, in IndexedDB, until server uploads exist.
- **Walls use one material for both faces.** `materialLeft` covers both, and per-side materials
  come in Phase 3.
- **No `project_versions` history yet.** It's planned with Postgres.
- **Moving a corner can make walls cross without splitting them.** Rooms are only re-detected by
  commands that change topology.
- **Room detection ignores holes.** A room inside another room isn't subtracted from it.
